## To Do for Diffusion-To-Bound Recall Model Project

### General Tasks

1. Add plotting commands to `d2b_conf.py` to allow for easy visualization of
goodness-of-fit with raw data.

2. Write a simple technical description of the model, including an explanation
of each of the parameters.

### Individual Word Fitting

Write code to determine the parameters for each of the individual
recalled/recognized words.

1. Decide whether to include only the target words or both the targets and
the lures (it may be best to start with just the target words)
    
2. Write code to separate out the relevant trials for a particular word and to
format the data appropriately for further processing by `compute_model_gof`.

3. Write a version of `find_ml_params` that fits only the parameters appropriate
to individual words (e.g., `mu_old, d` for single-process target words;
`mu_r,mu_f,d_f,d_r`, for dual-process target words).
